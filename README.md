# Control-Strategy-of-Hybrid-Vehicle

Based on the software advisor, here is a simulink model built to simulate the hybrid vehicle, where the rule-based 
control strategy is applied to distribution of energy demand between internal combustion engine and electrical motor.

In the program, the Main_Jiang.m is the main function.
